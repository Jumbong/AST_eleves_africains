Given her academic achievements and her work ethic, I expected her to pursue advanced studies and build a successful career. And that's exactly what happened--she went on to study at ENSAE, one of the most prestigious schools in France, and she is now an actuary.\n",

        "Now she is married too, and I hope she will find the same success in her marriage as she did in her studies and career. But this made me wonder: why do some people marry and others do not? What are the factors that influence the decision to marry?\n",
        "\n",
        "At her wedding, I began to reflect on this question using the story of my friend as a starting point. First, she and her husband come from similar social backgrounds—which I believe played a stabilizing role in their relationship.\n",

        "Then, there was distance. After her master’s, she earned a scholarship to continue her studies at ENSAE and moved to Paris, while her husband remained in Cameroon.

        "\n",
        "By the end of the ceremony, I had identified three key factors that seemed to have supported their union: shared social status, the ability to overcome physical distance, and the strength of their support network.

        "J'adore la bible parce que tu peux y trouver des réponses à toutes tes questions. Par exemple, si tu est quelqu'un qui travaille beaucoup et dort peu, si ton entourage te dit qu'il faut dormir, que le sommeil est réparateur. Si tu es fatigué par eux, tu peux leur répondre que d'après Proverbes 20:13, \"N'aime pas le sommeil, tu risquerais de t'appauvrir. Garde les yeux ouverts et tu seras rassasié de pain.\"\n",

        "La bible met en évidence la puissance de la parole. Par la parole, Dieu à créé le monde. Pour des non croyants, ceci peut être ridicule. Je pense qu'ils conviennent avec moi que ceux qui maitrisent la parole ont un pouvoir. Ils peuvent séduire, enchanter, persuader, parfois ils peuvent même manipuler. \n",

Il dit que la langue, qui permet de parler, a un pouvoir de vie et de mort; ceux qui aiment parler en goûteront les fruits. Ensuite, il conseille de refléchir avant de parler. Celui qui répond avant d'avoir écouté fait preuve de folie et se couvre de honte.\n",
